    <h1>Password generator</h1>
    <p>There are many password generators out there but this is my take on it. In the vein of the XKCD recommendation on
        entropy, I'm using a list of English words, a symbol, and a number to make a password. There are two options for
        English words, 5 letter and 6 letter. You can pick your own capitalization as you desire.</p>
    <p>Here is a sample password:</p>
    <h2>
        <div id="password"></div>
    </h2>
    <p>The source code for this is freely available in javascript, just view source on this page to see what I am doing.
    </p>
    <p>There is api access for this with options:-<br />
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://passwords.chinkes.workers.dev/password">5 letter words</li>
            <li><a href="https://passwords.chinkes.workers.dev/longpassword">6 letter words</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
